    <p style="font-style: italic">Playback Settings determine when a wallpaper's animations are allowed to play.</p>
    <p>By default, Wallpaper Engine's sounds and animations are constanty running regardless of what you are doing on your PC. You can change your Playback Settings so that animations mute, pause, or stop entirely depending on what other applications are doing on your PC.
