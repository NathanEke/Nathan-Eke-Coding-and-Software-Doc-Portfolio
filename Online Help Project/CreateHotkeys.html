    <h1>Create Hotkeys</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic">To quickly access Wallpaper Engine functions, you can create hotkeys.</p>
    <p>Hotkeys allow you to quickly alter Wallpaper Engine settings using a combination of keys rather than by going through the UI.</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Click "Settings" at the top of the application.</li>
                <li>Click "General."</li>
                <li>Next to "Hotkeys," click "Edit."</li>
                <li>Choose an option you'd like to make a hotkey for and click the box next to it. <ul><li>NOTE: All hotkey combinations must include Ctrl, Shift, or Alt.</li></ul></li>
                <li>Enter the combination of keys that you prefer then click "OK." You'll now be able to perform that action using the hotkey you created.</li>
            </ol>
