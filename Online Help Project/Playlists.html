    <p style="font-style: italic">Can't settle on just using one wallpaper at a time? Want to quickly cycle through wallpapers? Use the playlist feature.</p>
    <p>A playlist is a list of wallpapers that you've grouped together. You can set up a playlist to cycle through wallpapers on a regular basis. You can also set up a hotkey that will cycle through wallpapers in the playlist with the click of a button (or two).</p>
