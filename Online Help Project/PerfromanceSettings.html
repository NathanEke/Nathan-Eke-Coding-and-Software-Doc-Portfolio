    <h1>Performance Settings</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic">Change the performance settings according to the capabilities of your PC.</p>
    <p>Wallpaper Engine's animations can be taxing on your PC's resources, causing slowdowns or affecting the performance of other applications. Lowering certain Wallpaper Engine performance settings can free up resources and ensure your computer runs well while using the application. Alternatively, if you have a high end PC, you can turn up settings that give you the best graphics and performance that Wallpaper Engine has to offer.</p>
    <p>By clicking "Settings" at the top of the application, the Performance Settings menu will appear. Performance Settings are split into two categories: Playback Settings and Quality Settings.</p>
