    <h1>Quality Settings</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic">Quality Settings determine the graphical quality of Wallpaper Engine animations and effects.</p>
    <p>Wallpaper Engine's animations tax your computer's GPU and CPU. If you are having performance issues, you can lighten that load by lowering these quality settings. Alternatively, increase these settings for maximum graphical fidelity of your wallpapers. You can choose one of the presets (low, medium, high, ultra) to quickly configure these settings, but if you'd rather tune each setting individually, here are your options:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Anti-Aliasing: Determines how smoothed out edges are in your wallpaapers, making for a clearer, more realistic image.</li>
                <li>Post-Processing: Determines how many filters and effects are used to improve wallpaper image quality.</li>
                <li>Texture Resolution: Determines how detailed wallpaper textures are.</li>
                <li>FPS: Determines how many frames per second a wallpaper's animations can run at, making for a smoother or slower experience.</li>
                <li>Reflections: Determines whether or not reflections will be visible in your wallpapers.</li>
            </ul>
