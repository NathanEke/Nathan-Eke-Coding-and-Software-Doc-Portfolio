                <li>Audio Recording: Determines whether the wallpaper will display soundwaves based on your computer audio. </li>
                <li>Scheme Color: Controls the accent color of Windows.</li>
                <li>Playback Rate: Controls how fast a wallpaper's animation plays.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Controls how the wallpaper aligns to your desktop screen.</li>
                <li>Position: Controls the horizontal positoning of the wallpaper relative to your desktop.</li>
                <li>Flip: Flips the perspective of the wallpaper.</li>
